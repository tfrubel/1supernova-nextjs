    description: >-
      Scaleups succeed or fail based on hitting timely milestones. Less than 50%
      make it from Series A to Series B. Only 0.01% achieve unicorn status.
      Meanwhile, 97% of VCs claim they are 'value added' investors. Only 31% of
      Founders agree. Even startups backed by elite VCs want more output from
      their investors, advisors and stakeholders.
  - title: '**ANSWER:** SUPERNOVA'
    description: >
      Supernova is a growth stage accelerator run by 150+ exited founders to
      significantly improve success rates of Scaleups ($5MM to $100MM+) that go
      the distance. 70% of billion-dollar companies had repeat founders of at
      least one previously successful company (Super Founders).
