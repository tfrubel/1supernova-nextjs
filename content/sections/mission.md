    description: >-
      Scaleups succeed or fail based on hitting timely milestones. Many get
      stuck bridging capital rounds (Series A to C) and realize their full
      potential for a sizeable exit, IPO, unicorn status, or become a market
      leader. Meanwhile, 97% of VCs claim they are 'value added' investors. Only
      31% of Founders agree. Even those backed by elite VCs want more output
      from investors and advisors.
  - title: '**ANSWER:** SUPERNOVA'
    description: >
      Supernova is a growth stage accelerator run by 150+ exited founders to
      significantly improve success rates of Scaleups ($5MM to $100MM+) that go
      the distance. 70% of billion-dollar companies had repeat founders of at
      least one previously successful company (Super Founders).
