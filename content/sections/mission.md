    "Every founder needs a team that sees their blind spots, challenges their
    thinking, and pushes them toward greatness. We are that team. Weâ€™re in your
    corner, always."

    description: >-
      Scaleups succeed or fail based on hitting timely milestones. Many get
      stuck bridging capital rounds (Series A to C) or burn out before achieving
      a sizeable exit, IPO, or market leadership. Meanwhile, 97% of VCs claim
      they are 'value added' investors. Only 31% of Founders agree. Supernova
      fills this gap! Exited founders get hands-on for speed-to-value.

    description: >
      Supernova's exited founders significantly improve success rates of
      Scaleups ($5MM to $100MM+) that go the distance.
