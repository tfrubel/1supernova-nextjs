    description: >-
      97% of VC's claim they are 'value added' investors. Only 31% of Founders
      agree. Even startups backed by elite VC's want more output from their
      existing advisors and mentors.

      Only Supernova accelerates the realization of the founder's vision from
      the only perspective that truly understands the journey, as exited
      founders ourselves.
