  Scaling a startup is a game of high-stakes decisions. Every move matters,
  and the right mentors and advisors can mean the difference between
  exponential growth or costly mistakes. <br> At Supernova, we don’t just
  “advise”—we activate. We’re a team of 150+ exited founders who have been in
  your shoes, scaled companies to zebras, unicorns, and decacorns, and know
  what it takes to break through bottlenecks and win the game.<br> We’re not
  interested in theory. We’re here to roll up our sleeves and help you
  execute. We only work with founders who are ready to achieve oversized
  outcomes and positively impact lives.<br> If that sounds like you, apply
  now, and let’s see if we’re a fit.
