  invest—we activate. We are 250+ exited founders who have been in your shoes,
  scaled companies to zebras, unicorns, and decacorns, and know what it takes to
  go the distance and win the game.<br><br>.We don't sit on the sidelines—we get
  in the game with you. We don’t fck around. We back founders on a mission to
  build thriving businesses that make a real difference.<br><br> If that sounds
  like you, apply now, and let’s see if we’re a fit.
