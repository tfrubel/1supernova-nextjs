  - question: Why do I need a growth stage accelerator?
    answer: >-
      If you are leading a growth stage company ($5MM to $100MM+), then you
      already know it doesn't get any easier the bigger you get (<50% of Series
      A companies make it to Series B and 0.01% ever achieve unicorn status).
      Supernova is a team of 150+ successfully exited founders who fill specific
      needs, be it guidance, expertise, connections, mentorship, coaching and
      hands-on interim roles or tiger teams. They supply shortcuts, and cheat
      codes and help solve problems to help you get unstuck and accelerate
      speed-to-value. The founders’ journey to go the distance can be crazy
      complicated, but it doesn’t have to be. Our mission at Supernova is to
      accelerate the realization of the founder's vision from the only
      perspective that truly understands the journey, as exited founders
      ourselves. 
  - question: Is Supernova accepting applications?
    answer: >-
      Yes, Supernova is accepting applications for the 2025 portfolio. However,
      we are super selective and exclusive. To best serve the companies we work
      with and ensure impact, we limit our annual portfolio growth to 12
      high-growth startups (most often in Series A-C funding). Supernova
      advisors specialize primarily in AI, Health Tech, Fintech, SaaS,
      eCommerce, Impact and Web3. We are especially committed to supporting
      mission-driven companies solving modern-day problems.
  - question: How much does Supernova invest?
    answer: >-
      What Y-Combinator is to early-stage startups, Supernova is to Scaleups. 
      We are true 'growth stage accelerators'. Every portfolio company receives
      a check and 5 successfully exited founders and/or Super founders (previous
      exit of $50MM+) who team up to help accelerate key company milestones. We
      are the top-rated 'advisory-as-a-service' (90%+ NPS) with a proven record
      of scaling startups to unicorn status. We go way beyond the value-adds of
      traditional VC's with office hours, webinars and partner discounts. 
  - question: What if I don’t have time for Supernova?
    answer: >-
      Supernova is a managed service - aka we manage your bespoke exited founder
      team for you! Typically, we match each advisor to a member of your C-level
      management team. For example, an exited founder gifted in marketing
      advises your CMO. If you are too busy for us, then you likely need
      Supernova more than you realize! Typically, Founder/CEOs invest five a
      month, and see a significant return on the relationships. We bring proven
      methods, collaborative technology and expert resources to maximize shared
      efficiencies as your dedicated advisory team.
  - question: Why are exited founders motivated to back my company?
    answer: >-
      Supernova is similar to a YPO membership, but one where exited founders
      get to play the game of scaling businesses together with shared upside.
      Most of our exited founders have achieved success in their careers in some
      part thanks to the mentorship and advice they received along the way. In
      realizing that success, they are moved to pay forward the support. By
      working with Supernova, they are catalyzing more growth than what they
      could accomplish on their own as teaching is deeper learning. Supernova is
      curating opportunities to work with top companies for the exited founder,
      and making it hassle-free and turnkey to plug-n-play to source top deal
      flow, share their zones of genius and superpowers, on one platform free
      from administration and back office responsibilities. 
  - question: How does Supernova work with VCs?
    answer: >-
      Supernova helps VC’s go beyond office hours and webinars by providing
      access to the largest exited founder community of vetted advisors. A Tier
      1 VC partner of Supernova asked 100 founders in their portfolio, “How can
      we help?” Right behind sales growth, talent and funding, founders are
      begging for advisor and mentor support! Even top founders with elite VC
      backing want more output from their advisory boards, and Supernova is able
      to serve as a VC partner that produces higher satisfaction for all.
  - question: Why is it called Supernova?
    answer: "One Supernova shines 570 billion times brighter than the sun. One sun sustains all life on planet earth. We believe it’s time for solo stars (founders) to combine their life force energy and shine brighter together. By serving as spokes on one founder flywheel, we move energy more powerfully and efficiently through startups and their ecosystems. We exist to unify our superpowers as quantum creators and play as one all-star team for venture humanity.\U0001F31F"
