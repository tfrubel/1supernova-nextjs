lists:
  - question: Why do startups need advisors?
    answer: >-
      The right advisory relationships can help game startup success. Advisors
      fill specific needs, be it guidance, expertise, connections, mentorship,
      coaching and even hands-on support. They supply shortcuts, and cheat codes
      and help solve problems that can make or break businesses. The founders’
      journey is complicated, but it doesn’t have to be. Our mission at
      Supernova is to accelerate the realization of the founder's vision from
      the only perspective that truly understands the journey, as exited
      founders ourselves.
  - question: Is my company a fit for Supernova?
    answer: >-
      To best serve the companies we work with and ensure impact, we limit our
      annual portfolio growth to 12 high-growth startups (most often in Series
      A-C funding). Supernova advisors specialize primarily in AI, Health Tech,
      Fintech, SaaS, eCommerce, Impact and Web3. We are especially committed to
      supporting ventures that take an innovative approach to solving modern-day
      problems.
  - question: Who would my advisors be?
    answer: >-
      You’ll be matched with five exited founders who have relevant expertise
      with your company's near term priorities. As your needs evolve, so does
      your advisory team. We rotate talent in and out based on your dynamic
      needs. You are always in control and score advisors based on the
      achievement of measurable milestones to award equity based on merit vs.
      traditional vesting schedules. 
  - question: What if I don’t have time for my advisors?
    answer: >-
      Supernova is a managed service - aka we manage your exited founder team
      for you! Typically, we match each advisor to a member of your C-level
      management team. For example, an exited founder gifted in marketing
      advises your CMO. If you are too busy for us, then you likely need
      Supernova more than you realize! Typically, Founder/CEOs invest five a
      month, and see a significant return on the relationships. We bring proven
      methods, collaborative technology and expert resources to maximize shared
      efficiencies as your dedicated advisory team.
  - question: What's wrong with the traditional advisor model?
    answer: >-
      Most founders and startups struggle to recruit, engage, manage and
      incentivize their advisory boards. All too often they settle or allow
      their advisors to sit idle on the sidelines with little accountability.
      This despite giving away 5%+ company equity to their advisors over the
      lifetime of the business. Supernova is a new turnkey solution for
      curating, managing, incentivizing and holding your advisory board
      accountable.
  - question: What makes Supernova so different?
    answer: >-
      We are the first and only resource able to curate highly successfully
      exited entrepreneurs and adapt that all-star team to serve the evolving
      priorities and challenges of your company.  Whose advice do you trust
      most? A board member? Consultant? Banker? VC? SME? Our mission is to
      accelerate the realization of the founder's vision from the only
      perspective that truly understands the journey, as founders ourselves. 
  - question: How much does Supernova charge?
    answer: >-
      Supernova’s advisory service model is charged as a monthly, at-will
      subscription along with an equity allocation. We are held accountable to
      delivering measurable value by supporting critical decision making and
      initiatives that generate incremental gains in sales, partnerships,
      hiring, funding, and/or company valuation. For example, an early stage,
      Series A startup may invest 1% equity annually, plus a $10K monthly
      subscription. We pride ourselves in delivering significant ongoing return
      on relationships. 
  - question: Why are exited founders motivated to advise through Supernova?
    answer: >-
      Supernova advisors have achieved success in their careers in some part
      thanks to the help they received along the way. In realizing that success,
      they are moved to pay forward the support and guidance they once received
      as a founder and see the personal value in giving back to others that are
      in the position they once were. By working with Supernova, they are
      catalyzing more growth than what they could accomplish on their own.
      Supernova is curating opportunities to work with top startups for the
      exited founder, and making it easier for them to manage the day-to-day
      administration and incentive elements of advising. Similar to a doctor
      working in a practice versus doing it on their own, there are benefits to
      working with Supernova that helps them excel as a best-in-class advisory
      teams.
  - question: How does Supernova work with VCs?
    answer: >-
      Supernova helps VC’s go beyond office hours and webinars by providing
      access to the largest exited founder community of vetted advisors. A Tier
      1 VC partner of Supernova asked 100 founders in their portfolio, “How can
      we help?” Right behind sales growth, talent and funding, founders are
      begging for advisor and mentor support! Even top founders with elite VC
      backing want more output from their advisory boards, and Supernova is able
      to serve as a VC partner that produces higher satisfaction for all.
  - question: Why is it called Supernova?
    answer: "One Supernova shines 570 billion times brighter than the sun. One sun sustains all life on planet earth. We believe it’s time for solo stars (founders) to combine their life force energy and shine brighter together. By serving as spokes on one founder flywheel, we move energy more powerfully and efficiently through startups and their ecosystems. We exist to unify our superpowers as quantum creators and play as one all-star team for venture humanity.\U0001F31F"
