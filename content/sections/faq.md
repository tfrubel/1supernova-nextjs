  - question: What is so special about Supernova?
    answer: >-
      If you are leading a growth stage company ($5MM to $100MM+), then you
      already know it doesn't get any easier the bigger you get. Scaling teams,
      entering new markets, bridging financing rounds, M&A, etc. The founders’
      journey to go the distance can be crazy complicated, but it doesn’t have
      to be. Our mission at Supernova is to accelerate the realization of the
      founder's vision from the only perspective that truly understands the
      journey, as exited founders ourselves. Stacking successfully exited
      founders on your team is a game-changer. They supply shortcuts, and cheat
      codes and help solve problems to help you get unstuck and accelerate
      speed-to-value. They fill specific needs - guidance, expertise,
      connections, mentorship, coaching and can even get hands-on serving in
      interim roles or tiger teams. 70% of unicorns were built by repeat
      founders of at least one previously successful company. That's why
      founders with multiple exits still tag in Supernova despite their past
      success because they know the advantage it brings when scaling their
      companies successfully.
  - question: Is Supernova accepting applications?
    answer: >-
      Supernova is now accepting applications for the 2025 portfolio. To best
      serve the companies we work with and ensure impact, we limit our annual
      portfolio growth to 12 high-growth Scaleups (Series A-C funding or
      bootstrapped to $5MM+ ARR). Supernova advisors specialize primarily in AI,
      Health Tech, Fintech, SaaS, eCommerce, Impact, and Web3. We are especially
      committed to supporting mission-driven companies solving modern-day
      problems.
  - question: How much does Supernova invest?
    answer: >-
      What Y-Combinator is to early-stage startups, Supernova is to Scaleups. 
      Every portfolio company receives a check (amounts range from $100K-$1MM+),
      and more importantly 5 successfully exited founders and/or Super founders
      (previous exit of $50MM+) who team up and get hands-on to help accelerate
      company milestones. As the saying goes, wisdom is more precious than gold
      and it's our commitment to transfer our experience, especially for
      million-dollar decisions. We are the top-rated 'advisory-as-a-service'
      (90%+ NPS) with a proven record of scaling startups to unicorn status and
      beyond.
  - question: What if I don’t have time for Supernova?
    answer: >-
      Our guiding North Star is TIME. We don't waste time - yours, your teams,
      or our exited founders! In fact, we invented advisory-as-a-serviceTM to
      formalize and streamline elite mentorship and advisory services. We begin
      by matching each exited founder from Supernova to a member of your C-level
      team. For example, your CMO is supported by a successfully exited founder
      whose zone of genius addresses your most pressing problems or
      opportunities. Typically, we request that your leadership invests an
      average of five to ten hours monthly to level up and benefit from our
      exited founders' knowledge transfer of wisdom, experience, resources, and
      connections. It's said that we help them make smarter "million-dollar
      decisions" and that saves time over time with significant returns on the
      relationships. If you are too busy for us, you may need Supernova more
      than you realize! Are you ready to scale in "Conscious Mode"?
  - question: Why do successfully exited founders join Supernova?
    answer: >-
      Supernova is similar to a YPO membership with intimate groups that
      function as supreme sounding boards. The difference is that with
      Supernova, successfully exited founders get to play the game of scaling
      businesses together and sharing upside in successful outcomes. We are a
      peer group with 150+ successfully exited founders who all believe we can
      catalyze more growth than what they could accomplish on our own. Most of
      our exited founders have achieved success in their careers in some part
      thanks to the mentorship and advice they received along the way. In
      realizing that success, they are moved to pay forward the support. By
      working with Supernova, they unlock the opportunity to invest and get
      equity in growth-stage companies as an energy exchange by leveraging their
      battle-tested wisdom, experience, and social capital. Supernova curates
      opportunities to engage with top companies in a hassle-free way by
      sourcing top deal flow and serving up invitations to participate as
      advisors, mentors, investors, or even join in interim or full-time roles
      or tiger teams. Supernova is turnkey and handles all the administration
      and back-office support.
  - question: How does Supernova work with VCs?
    answer: >-
      Supernova helps VC’s go beyond office hours and webinars by providing
      access to the largest exited founder community of vetted advisors. A Tier
      1 VC partner of Supernova asked 100 founders in their portfolio, “How can
      we help?” Right behind sales growth, talent and funding, founders are
      begging for advisor and mentor support! Even top founders with elite VC
      backing want more output from them. Did you know? 70% of billion-dollar
      companies had repeat founders of at least one previously successful
      company. We serve as founder flywheels and help their teams scale success
      and impact.
  - question: Why is it called Supernova?
    answer: "One Supernova shines 570 billion times brighter than the sun. One sun sustains all life on planet earth. We believe it’s time for solo stars (super founders) to combine their life force energy and shine brighter together. By serving as spokes on one founder flywheel, we move energy more powerfully and efficiently through startups and their ecosystems. We exist to unify our superpowers as quantum creators and play as one all-star team for venture humanity.\U0001F31F"
