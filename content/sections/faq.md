  - question: What is a growth stage accelerator?
    answer: >-
      If you are leading a growth stage company ($5MM to $100MM+), then you
      already know it doesn't get any easier the bigger you get. Scaling teams,
      entering new markets, bridging financing rounds, M&A, etc. The founders’
      journey to go the distance can be crazy complicated, but it doesn’t have
      to be. Our mission at Supernova is to accelerate the realization of the
      founder's vision from the only perspective that truly understands the
      journey, as exited founders ourselves. Stacking successfully exited
      founders on your team is a game-changer. They supply shortcuts, and cheat
      codes and help solve problems to help you get unstuck and accelerate
      speed-to-value. They fill specific needs - guidance, expertise,
      connections, mentorship, coaching and even can get hands-on serving in
      interim roles or tiger teams. 70% of unicorns were built by repeat
      founders of at least one previously successful company. That's why even
      founders with multiple exits bring Supernova on board because they know
      the advantage it brings when scaling companies to successful outcomes. 
  - question: Is Supernova accepting applications?
    answer: >-
      Yes, Supernova is now accepting applications for the 2025 portfolio. To
      best serve the companies we work with and ensure impact, we limit our
      annual portfolio growth to 12 high-growth startups (most often in Series
      A-C funding or bootstrapped to $5MM+ ARR). Supernova advisors specialize
      primarily in AI, Health Tech, Fintech, SaaS, eCommerce, Impact and Web3.
      We are especially committed to supporting mission-driven companies solving
      modern-day problems. We love companies ready to scale in "Conscious
      Founder Mode". 
  - question: How much does Supernova invest?
    answer: >-
      What Y-Combinator is to early-stage startups, Supernova is to Scaleups. 
      We are true 'growth stage accelerators' and every portfolio company
      receives a check and the time from 5 successfully exited founders and/or
      Super founders (previous exit of $50MM+) who team up to help accelerate
      key company milestones. We are the top-rated 'advisory-as-a-service' (90%+
      NPS) with a proven record of scaling startups to unicorn status. We get
      hands-on and go way beyond the traditional value-adds of office hours,
      webinars, and partner discounts.
  - question: What if I don’t have time for Supernova?
    answer: >-
      Our guiding North Star is TIME. Making the most of time, for you, your
      team, and our exited founders. That's why we invented
      advisory-as-a-serviceTM to formalize and streamline elite mentorship and
      advisory services. We begin by matching each exited founder from Supernova
      to a member of your C-level team. For example, your CMO is supported by a
      successfully exited founder whose zone of genius addresses your most
      pressing problems or opportunities. Typically, we request that your
      leadership invests an average of five to ten hours a month each to level
      up through our knowledge transfer of wisdom, experience, resources and
      connections. It's said that in exchange of this time, we help make smarter
      "million-dollar decisions" that ultimately save time over time. And, often
      result in a significant return on the relationships. If you are too busy
      for us, you likely need Supernova more than you realize! 
  - question: Why are exited founders motivated to back my company?
    answer: >-
      Supernova is similar to a YPO membership, but one where exited founders
      get to play the game of scaling businesses together and with shared
      upside. Most of our exited founders have achieved success in their careers
      in some part thanks to the mentorship and advice they received along the
      way. In realizing that success, they are moved to pay forward the support.
      By working with Supernova, they are catalyzing more growth than what they
      could accomplish on their own as teaching is deeper learning. Supernova is
      curating opportunities to work with top companies for the exited founder,
      and making it hassle-free and turnkey to plug-n-play to source top deal
      flow, share their zones of genius and superpowers, on one platform free
      from administration and back office responsibilities. 
  - question: How does Supernova work with VCs?
    answer: >-
      Supernova helps VC’s go beyond office hours and webinars by providing
      access to the largest exited founder community of vetted advisors. A Tier
      1 VC partner of Supernova asked 100 founders in their portfolio, “How can
      we help?” Right behind sales growth, talent and funding, founders are
      begging for advisor and mentor support! Even top founders with elite VC
      backing want more output from them. Did you know?  70% of billion-dollar
      companies had repeat founders of at least one previously successful
      company (Super Founders). We provide a superior advantage for companies
      scaling their success and impact. 
  - question: Why is it called Supernova?
    answer: "One Supernova shines 570 billion times brighter than the sun. One sun sustains all life on planet earth. We believe it’s time for solo stars (super founders) to combine their life force energy and shine brighter together. By serving as spokes on one founder flywheel, we move energy more powerfully and efficiently through startups and their ecosystems. We exist to unify our superpowers as quantum creators and play as one all-star team for venture humanity.\U0001F31F"
