  title: Why Supernova Exists
  quote: We orbit around your needs as all-star advisory teams.
  content_left: >
    **The founders’ journey is innately challenging;** it’s why so few have the
    endurance to make it all the way through. Seeking and building a team of
    advisors to strengthen the founder’s decision-making and strategy is a
    powerful way to increase the probability of success. Unfortunately, finding
    actual experienced startup advisors who can care for you and the mission is
    difficult. And if you do find them, how do you ensure that they are properly
    utilized and incentivized? <br/><br/>


    For decades, traditional advising for most founders and their companies has
    been essentially non-existent, or so informal that it leaves something to be
    desired. Boards are often serving this role, but with incentives and
    responsibilities that don’t allow for the openness and transparency needed
    to overcome many challenges we face.

    **The perfect advisor does not exist**, but a dynamic team that adapts to
    your current company challenges, and knows what you are going through
    because they too have been a founder is “the perfect advisor.” <br/><br/>


    **Supernova is the future of startup advising.** We are the first and only
    resource able to curate successfully exited entrepreneurs and adapt that
    team to serve the evolving priorities and challenges of your company.
    <br/><br/>


    **Our mission is to accelerate the realization of the founder's vision**
    from the only perspective that truly understands the journey, as founders
    ourselves. Supernova is the future of startup advising.
