### About Company

Apollo (apolloneuro.com) is the first vibration therapy system clinically proven to reduce stress, improve sleep, and restore balance to the nervous system.  More than 75% of Americans claim they get physically ill from stress; 31% have an anxiety disorder diagnosis and 51% struggle to sleep.

### Biggest Challenge

The company initially launched with a consumer wearable and grew to $10MM+ in annual revenues. However, to unlock their full potential to scale (and positively impact more lives) the company knew it must expand into a multi-form factor platform. Evolving from a Startup into a Scaleup is a critical transition, especially in bridging capital rounds and refactoring the team while proving GTM success with key milestones.
