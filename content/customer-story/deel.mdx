### About Company

Apollo (apolloneuro.com) is the first vibration therapy system clinically proven to reduce stress, improve sleep, and restore balance to the nervous system, initially launched with a wearable and now expanding into a multi-form factor platform.  

### Challenage or Problem

We are especially interested in finding developers with experience either building web APIs with Go or experience with functional programming (e.g. Elixir, NodeJS, Clojure, F#). You might not have experience with all the technologies in our stack, but you are motivated to learn deeply. You will get the opportunity to work with both Go and Elixir with experienced team mates who can teach and pair with you to learn whatever you have less experience with.You care about security, code quality, scalability, performance, and simplicity. Above all, you seek operational excellence and apply the best engineering practices possible. Not everything that you or your team do can be perfect, but you make sure that you always know the trade-offs.
