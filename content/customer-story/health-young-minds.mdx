### Growth Opportunity

Apollo launched with a consumer wearable and grew to $10MM+ in annual revenues. However, to unlock its full potential and scale (to positively impact more lives) the company knew it must expand into a multi-form factor platform. This critical transition required bridging capital rounds, refactoring the team, expanding revenue streams, proving GTM success, and achieving key company milestones.  

### Supernova Impact

* LEADERSHIP - Recruited and placed an Interim-CFO (former CFO of Beats By Dre; Sold to Apple) to lead financial planning and scenarios for a clear path to profitability (targeting a Series B round in 2025).
* PARTNERSHIPS - Closed licensing deals to leverage Apollo’s patented software and prove it's hardware-agnostic and can be delivered through mobile phones, wearables, and any haptic devices that vibrate, such as headphones and smart beds.
* GTM - Diversified revenue streams: 1.) Apollo wearable (MRSP $349 with 76% gross margin) and 2.) AI Vibes ($199.99 device-as-a-service annual subscription). 3.) Apollo LITE (phone-only subscription $9.99/mo). 4.) Enterprise sales deals (B2B)
* GROWTH - Supported growth goals in sales and marketing to grow revenues to almost $1M ARR monthly (August 2024); projected 75% YoY growth. 130K customers and growing (100K 5-star reviews); highly engaged, with an average use of 4.5 hours/day and active retention of over 80% after 12 months.Targeting the $19B+ stress management, $18B+ sleep tech, and the $77B+ overall wearable markets.
* COMMUNITY - Spearheading an upcoming Kickstart campaign to pre-sell Generation 2 product launch leveraging the support of the Apollo community.
