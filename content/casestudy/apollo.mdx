### Company Overview

[Apollo Neuro](https://apolloneuro.com/) is the first vibration therapy system **clinically proven** to reduce stress, improve sleep, and restore the nervous system.

### Growth-Stage Opportunity

Apollo launched with a consumer wearable and **grew to $10MM+ in annual revenues**. However, the company realized to scale to it's full potential it must expand into a multi-form factor platform. This critical transition required additional capital, expanding revenue streams, proving GTM success, refactoring the team, and achieving key company milestones.

### Supernova Impact

* **FUNDING** - Supernova's exited founders revamped the pitch deck, financials, deal room, investor outreach, ran demo days and directly invested $350K to accelerate the closing of a Series A ($30MM) led by insiders and VC's such as Noetic, Satori, and Blueprint N-1.
* **LEADERSHIP** - Recruited and placed an Interim-CFO (former CFO of Beats By Dre; Sold to Apple) to lead financial planning and scenarios for a clear path to profitability (targeting a Series B round in 2025).
* **PARTNERSHIPS** - Closed licensing deals to leverage Apolloâ€™s patented software and prove it's hardware-agnostic and can be delivered through mobile phones, wearables, and any haptic devices that vibrate, such as headphones and smart beds.
* \*\*GTM \*\*- Diversified revenue streams: 1.) Apollo wearable (MRSP $349 with 76% gross margin) and 2.) AI Vibes ($199.99 device-as-a-service annual subscription). 3.) Apollo LITE (phone-only subscription $9.99/mo). 4.) Enterprise sales deals (B2B)
* **GROWTH -** Supported growth goals in sales and marketing to grow revenues to almost $1M ARR monthly (August 2024); projected 75% YoY growth. 130K customers and growing (100K 5-star reviews); highly engaged, with an average use of 4.5 hours/day and active retention of over 80% after 12 months.
* **COMMUNITY** - Spearheading a Kickstart campaign to pre-sell products for a Gen 2 launch by leveraging the support of the Apollo community.
