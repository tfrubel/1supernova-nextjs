Welcome to the SUPERNOVA ® website.  Protecting your personal privacy is important to SUPERNOVA ®  (“we,” “us,” or “SUPERNOVA ® ”).  The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand how SUPERNOVA ®  collects, uses and safeguards the information you provide to us.  This Privacy Policy applies only to the website located at [https://www.1SUPERNOVA](https://www.1supernova) ®.com (the “Site”), and not to any other website or service.

By using or accessing the Site, you signify your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE.

Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect

SUPERNOVA ®  will not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.  Personally identifiable information may include your name, email address, physical address and other information that specifically identifies you. SUPERNOVA ®  also will not sell your personal information to third-parties.

Non-Personal or Aggregate Information That We Collect

When you access the Site, we may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information from you (through cookies and other methods), such as IP address, web pages viewed, browser type, referring service, usage and browsing habits on the Site, and similar data.

### Information Use

We will only use your personally identifiable information as described below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use, either at the time the personally identifiable information is collected from you or through some other form of consent from you or notification to you:

We may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your inquiries or requests.

We may use your personally identifiable information to send emails from time to time, but we will not provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for them to contact you directly unless otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy or if you provide your consent.

We may permit our vendors and subcontractors to access your personally identifiable information, but they are only permitted to do so in connection with performing services for us. They are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit.

We may disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or legal process.

We may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, or the terms or policies for our services or our clients.

We may transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with the sale or merger or change of control of the Site, SUPERNOVA ®  or the division responsible for the services with which your personally identifiable information is associated.

We may share your personally identifiable information with an affiliate of SUPERNOVA ®  who is in the same corporate family as us as long as their privacy practices are substantially similar to ours.

Non-personally identifiable or aggregate information may be shared with any number of parties, provided that such information shall not specifically identify you.

### Client Data

We provide services for our clients, and may collect and process information about individuals at the direction of our clients (“Client Data”). Our processing of Client Data is governed by the terms of our service agreements with our clients, and not this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for how our clients treat the information we collect on their behalf, and we recommend you review their own privacy policies. SUPERNOVA ®  acknowledges that you may have rights in connection with Client Data. If your information has been processed by SUPERNOVA ®  on behalf of a client and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such information, please inquire with our client directly. If you wish to make your request directly to SUPERNOVA ® , please provide the name of the SUPERNOVA ®  client on whose behalf SUPERNOVA ®  processed your information. We will refer your request to that client, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.

### Security

We take appropriate commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and other security measures to help safeguard personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.  Even though we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your information will be secure in all circumstances

### Rights and Choices for California Residents

The California Consumer Privacy Act  of 2018 (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2023 (“CPRA”) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA and CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.

### Right to Know

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months  (“the Right to Know”). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will disclose to you:

The categories of personal information we collected about you.

The categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business or commercial purpose and an explanation of the business or commercial purpose that the personal information was used for.

The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.

The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also known as a data portability request).

### Right to Delete

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions (the “right to delete”). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us to:

Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities, to the extent that the use of your personal information is reasonable and proportionate for these purposes;

Debug to repair and identify and repair errors that impair functionality;

Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;

Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code §1546 et. seq.);

Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;

Comply with a legal obligation; and

Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

We will delete or deidentify personal information not subject to one of these exceptions from our records and direct any of our service providers to take similar action.

### Correct Inaccurate Personal Information

You have the right to request that we correct any potential incorrect personal information that we may have about you.

### Exercising Your Rights

To exercise your rights to know or delete described above, please submit a request by either:

Emailing Us at info\@1SUPERNOVA ®.com

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your personal information.

You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information; and

Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it.

### Response Timing and Format

We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us.

We hope to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to an additional 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing, by mail or electronically.
Upon verifying your request to delete, we will delete your personal information from our records, and notify any Service Providers or Contractors to delete your personal information. We will also notify any Third Parties that we may have shared the personal information with to delete it unless this proves impossible, involves disproportionate effort or the personal information is subject to one of the exceptions listed above.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons that we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA or CPRA rights.
