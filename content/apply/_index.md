        **Founders build the future they wish to see.** They free us from our
        past by disrupting trillion-dollar industries. They are powerful
        creators or destroyers. They don’t have all the answers. They let few in
        their inner circle to influence decisions. Decisions that make or break
        realities and relationships.

        **Like our ancestors, it’s time they look to the stars to successfully
        navigate the hero’s journey.** The dark side of startup life is no joke.

        purpose is to be guiding lights. Shining brighter together as we team up
        together as all-star teams backing founders dreams to accelerate key
        milestones and create a supernova of oversized impact on the world. ⭐
